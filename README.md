## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for sentiment analysis and text similarity comparison using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of input text, while text similarity measures the similarity between two input texts. These techniques are commonly used in various applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and recommendation systems. 

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of input text using the VADER sentiment analyzer.
- **Text Similarity:** Measures the similarity between two input texts using spaCy's word embeddings and cosine similarity.

## File Structure
- `sentiment_similarity_analysis.py`: Main Python script for performing sentiment analysis and text similarity comparison.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries for easy installation. You can find more information on how to install python packages here - [https://www.listendata.com/2019/04/install-python-package.html#method_2_no_need_of_anaconda]
- `amazon_products_reviews.csv`: Sample dataset containing Amazon product reviews. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products]
